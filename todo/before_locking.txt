- Remove placeholder files once actual files are added to the directory
- No need to include the actual path of header files thanks to `-Iinclude` in 
the makefile.

Before locking the project:
- The compiler must be the `c++` shortcut.
- Source files in the makefile are to be hardcoded, not fetched automatically.
- Remove unused header inclusions.
- Remove the todo/ directory.
- Remove the tests/ directory, or at least the intra testers.

README (for the intra only, not GitHub):
- Remove the first line `# Teapot`.
- Modify the new first line (with our names) to be subject compliant:
	The very first line must be italicized and read: This project has been 
	created as part of the 42 curriculum by <login1>[, <login2>[, <login3>[...]]].
- Change all mentions of "Teapot" into "Webserv".
- Remove the detail blocks.
- Modify the git clone link to be the vogsphere.
