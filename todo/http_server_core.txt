- Each domain (host/port pair) has its cookie list.

- When a request has the Cookie header, parse in order to have the cookie list 
of this request. There shouldn't be a semi-colon at the end of the header 
value, but tolerate it. This example has three cookies:

```
Cookie: name0=value0
Cookie: name1=value1; name2=value2
```

- The response for this request should tell the client to delete any cookie the 
domain doesn't recognize:
`Set-Cookie: weirdCookie=; Max-Age=0; Path=/`

- If the cookie is recognized, it can be used for something, but this doesn't 
concern the response.

- If no valid cookie was sent with the request, the server generates one. This 
cookie is sent with the response. Then, for this ongoing connection, we don't 
send a new cookie again, so have a boolean to remember that a cookie has just 
been issued but the client doesn't "bother" with returning it to you (it could 
be a case of pipelining, which explains that).

- The cookie is a background color with a hex code, randomly generated:
`Set-Cookie: background-color=#4468A6; Path=/`

- The background color is to be used with the HTML page that's being returned, 
if it's an HTML page.
Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body style="background-color: #4468A6;">
</body>
</html>
```

- Use the background color when the cookie is being issued, and then keep using 
it for this connection, unless a request sends a new color (and it's one the 
domain recognizes). If the request has different colors, use the last one to 
keep things simple, instead of going for a gradient.
