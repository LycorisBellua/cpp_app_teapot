- When a request has the Cookie header, parse in order to have the cookie list 
of this request. There shouldn't be a semi-colon at the end of the header 
value, but tolerate it. This example has three cookies:

```
Cookie: name0=value0
Cookie: name1=value1; name2=value2
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO
- The listener has an IP and a port.
- Each IP/port pair has a list of cookies.

- Use the domain/port values to know which cookie list to use:
	* If host is empty and port is 0 -> Fetch the first server.
	* If host is empty but we have the port -> Fetch the first server with this port.
	* If we have the host but port is 0 -> Fetch the first server with this host.
	* If we have both the host and the port -> Fetch the first server that matches with both.
	* And if no such server has been found, we might have a server with "0.0.0.0" and with this exact port.
	* Otherwise abort, there's no need to tell the client to delete any cookie, because the host is invalid anyway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Each domain (host/port pair) has its cookie list.

- The response for this request should tell the client to delete any cookie the 
domain doesn't recognize:
`Set-Cookie: weirdCookie=value; Max-Age=0; Path=/`

- If the cookie is recognized, it can be used for something, but this doesn't 
concern the response.

- If no valid cookie was sent with the request, the server generates one. This 
cookie is sent with the response. Then, for this ongoing connection, we don't 
send a new cookie again, so have a boolean to remember that a cookie has just 
been issued but the client doesn't "bother" with returning it to you (it could 
be a case of pipelining, which explains that).

- The cookie is a background color with a hex code, randomly generated:
`Set-Cookie: background-color=#4468A6; Path=/`

- The background color is to be used with the HTML page that's being returned, 
if it's an HTML page.
Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body style="background-color: #4468A6;">
</body>
</html>
```

- Use the background color when the cookie is being issued, and then keep using 
it for this connection, unless a request sends a new color (and it's one the 
domain recognizes). If the request has different colors, use the last one to 
keep things simple, instead of going for a gradient.
