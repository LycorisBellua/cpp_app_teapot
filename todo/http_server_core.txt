COOKIE TESTS
- [X] Cookie is generated if the request provides none.
- [X] Embedding the background color into the HTML body tag.
- [X] The same background color survives a browser refresh or reopening.
- [X] Different cookie on different session (= different browser, 
	  or "localhost" vs "127.0.0.1").
- [X] If request provides wrong cookie (name and/or value), client is told to 
	  delete it, and a new valid one is provided.

TODO COOKIE
- Maybe remove a cookie server-side if enough time passed (Max-Age).
- If you do that, then also add a domain and a path to the cookie. Add the 
whole thing, for a cookie is not just a KVP.

CONFIG TESTS
- Accessing "0.0.0.0:8080" in the browser led to a server crash:
	```

	[Router] No Matching server found for request
	Port: 8080
	Host: 0.0.0.0
	URI: /
