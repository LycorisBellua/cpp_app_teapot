For cookies, we need to provide a working example, and I suggest using 
background colors. For each user session, which is expressed by cookies, the 
HTML pages we send back will have these specific colors. Colors will be used in 
the order of the cookies sent with the request. It could be one cookie for one 
color, or a gradient if more cookies are used. As for cookie values that don't 
translate to a hex code, it's okay, as we can see cookies in the browser anyway.

Example with two colors (from top to bottom):
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<style>
		body
		{
			margin: 0;
			min-height: 100vh;
			background: linear-gradient(#e66465, #9198e5);
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

[Map request to a route]

- Call the routing API
- Determine:
	* which file to serve
	* whether to run CGI
	* allowed methods
	* upload directory
	* redirects

[Handle cookies and session management]

- Read `Cookie` headers from request
- Look up session in memory or using session ID
- Create new session if none exists or expired
- Attach session data to request context for route handlers

[Build the HTTP response]

- Headers
- Body (static file, upload result, CGI output, error page, etc)

[Set cookies for session management]

- If session was created or modified -> send `Set-Cookie` header
- Include any other cookies the route requires
