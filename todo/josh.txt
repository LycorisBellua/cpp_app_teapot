Normalise paths in Config:
 -> Will allow paths to be independent of CWD when program launched
 -> Convert root, upload_path, cgi_path and error messages to absolute values
 -> Append missing trailing '/'
 -> After config file is parsed, only absolute paths are used
 -> Confirm existence of the above
