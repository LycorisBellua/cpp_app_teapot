- Remove placeholder files once actual files are added to the directory
- No need to include the actual path of header files thanks to `-Iinclude` in 
the makefile.

Before locking the project:
- The compiler must be the `c++` shortcut.
- Source files in the makefile are to be hardcoded, not fetched automatically.
- Check forbidden functions with `nm`.
- Remove the todo/ directory.
- Remove the tests/ directory, or at least the intra testers.
