- Issue with the cookies? Why does the color change when I go for example from 
localhost:8080 to localhost:9999 and then back to 8080?

- Merge.

- Test this to make sure the error is gone:
	Accessing "0.0.0.0:8080" in the browser led to a server crash:
	```
	2026-01-26 15:58:17 ERROR
	[Router] No Matching server found for request
	Port: 8080
	Host: 0.0.0.0
	URI: /
	Method: GET
	
	zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./webserv
	```
- Test HEAD method in the CLI (it must work when GET is allowed):
	`curl -v --http1.1 -X HEAD http://localhost:8080/`
	`printf "HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:8080\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 8080`
- Test the DELETE method wthin the browser.
- Test three different types of CGI.
- Figure out a list of tests to check whether the CGI feature breaks for when 
we'll rework it.
